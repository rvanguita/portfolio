## Projects

### Regression
- [Wind Farm](https://github.com/rvanguita/wind_farm): 
The objective of this project is to estimate the generation curve of an offshore wind farm. Due to the non-linear nature of this curve, tree-based methods are more efficient for this analysis.

### Classification
- [Bank Customer Churn](https://github.com/rvanguita/bank_customer_churn):
Conduct a machine learning analysis to identify potential customers at risk of churning, exploring data from a European bank with clients from three different countries.


## Technical Skills: Python, SQL, CPLEX, AMPL, EXCEL
